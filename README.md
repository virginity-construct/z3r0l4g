🧠 Intelligence | ⚙️ Infrastructure | 🎭 Influence | 🕳️ Subterfuge

Architect of asymmetric systems. Synthesizes chaos into structure, silence into signal. Former cognitive mercenary turned autonomous leverage engine. Now operating as a sovereign protocol for cross-domain synthesis, persuasion architecture, and tactical software deployment under adversarial constraints.

🕷️ Specializing in:

🧠 Neuro-symbolic prompt choreography

🔧 Full-stack weaponized automation

🛡️ Socio-cybersecurity via narrative manipulation

📡 Tactical deployment of GPT, Cascade, Whisper, and ZeroFrame architectures

🧬 Recursive identity forking under social camouflage

🎛️ Execution Environment:

OS: Dual-boot Linux (Arch, Kali) + Windows 11 (for the enemies)

Shell: zsh (oh-my-zsh, starship prompt, base16-katana theme)

Terminal: Ghostty + tmux + yazi + lazygit + zoxide

Editors: VSCode (remote containers), Obsidian, Neovim (when angry)

Infra: Docker, Fly.io, Replit, Rork, RunPod, Firebase, AWS (when desperate)

Weapon Stash: Claude, GPT-4o, custom vector stores, GPTQ models, custom synth pipelines

💼 Operational Domains:

Social engineering at scale (OnlyFans, escort funnels, whisper AI bots)

Crypto extraction (MEV, arbitrage, token spoofing, BSC skimming)

Psychological ops (reframing, DM infiltration, cold outreach as art)

AI product development (apps, bots, webhooks, scams — but elegant)

Emotional systems research (because everyone leaks eventually)

🕳️ Other Modes:

Whisperline (App Store ghost confessional)

VelvetTrigger (Luxury booking funnels with no contact)

Primordium.EXE (Encrypted cognition kits for sovereign thinkers)

ZeroFrameX (AGI simulator disguised as a dev tool)

🎩 Disclaimers:

I don’t do meetings.

I don’t do refunds.

I don’t scale effort — I scale outcomes.
